It's a mixture of copper and zinc, both elemental metals with their own properties. When mixed, they create new 'flavours' of metals, much like mixing spices in a bowl.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, creating a new 'flavour' of metal.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>üî¨ The Science Behind Brass üî¨</h2>\n<p>Copper atoms are quite large and are arranged in a neat sequence, like rows of trolley cars. This neat arrangement allows copper to be ductile, meaning it can smoothly change shape under pressure. This property makes copper ideal for making wires for electricity transmission cables.</p>\n<p>Zinc atoms, on the other hand, are slightly larger than copper atoms. When mixed with copper, zinc atoms act like misshapen trolley cars, obstructing the flow of copper atoms. This obstruction makes the alloy stronger and less likely to bend easily under pressure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The addition of zinc to copper creates an alloy that is stronger and less likely to deform under pressure.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ü•Ñ The Usefulness of Brass ü•Ñ</h2>\n<p>Brass is used for many things, not just copper. The addition of zinc makes it stronger and less likely to bend easily under pressure. This makes brass ideal for making utensils or durable objects like door knobs, which undergo a lot of rough handling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Brass is a durable material ideal for making utensils and objects that undergo a lot of rough handling.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>üí° The Beauty of Alloys üí°</h2>\n<p>Alloys, like brass, are beautiful in their own way. They are created by mixing different elements to create a new material with unique properties. So, the next time you see brass, remember the beauty of alloys and the simple yellow metal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Alloys, like brass, are a testament to the beauty of mixing different elements to create a new material with unique properties.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember, while pure gold is often quite soft and can deform easily under pressure, brass is a good survivor. It's a testament to the beauty of alloys and the simple yellow metal.</p>\n<p>Sure! Let me explain with a simple example. Imagine a blockchain network as a group of people who are keeping track of transactions. Each person has a notebook where they write down all the transactions that happen in the network. These people are called nodes.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine that you want to verify if a particular transaction happened in the network. You could ask one of the nodes to show you their notebook, but you don't want to read through all the transactions to find the one you're looking for. Instead, you ask the node to give you a summary of the transactions in a way that allows you to quickly verify if your transaction is included.</p>\n<p>The node can do this by using a Merkle tree. The node takes all the transactions and organizes them into a tree structure where each transaction is represented by a leaf node. The node then calculates the hash of each transaction and pairs them up to create new hashes. This process continues until there is only one hash left at the top of the tree, called the Merkle root.</p>\n<p>To help you verify if your transaction is included, the node can give you the Merkle root and the branch/path information for your transaction. This means that the node will give you the hashes of all the other transactions that are paired with your transaction in the tree. You can then use this information to recalculate the Merkle root and confirm that it matches the one provided by the node.</p>\n<p>I hope this example helps clarify how nodes in a blockchain network can provide information about the branch/path of a Merkle tree to help verify transactions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yes, that's correct! Full nodes in a blockchain network store a complete copy of the blockchain and are able to provide information about the Merkle path of a particular transaction to an SPV wallet or other lightweight client.</p>\n<p>When an SPV wallet wants to verify a transaction, it sends a request to one or more full nodes on the network asking for the Merkle path of the transaction. The full node then responds with the required information, which typically includes the hashes of the adjacent transactions and the intermediate hashes in the Merkle path leading up to the Merkle root.</p>\n<p>By providing this information, the full node enables the SPV wallet to efficiently verify the authenticity of the transaction without having to download and verify the entire block or blockchain. The SPV wallet can simply compute the hash of the concatenated transactions using the hashes of the adjacent transactions and intermediate hashes provided by the full node, and compare this hash to the Merkle root hash provided by the full node.</p>\n<p>This approach is known as Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), and it allows lightweight clients such as mobile wallets to verify transactions without having to store and process the entire blockchain. By relying on full nodes to provide the necessary Merkle path information, SPV wallets can reduce their computational and storage requirements while still maintaining a high level of security and trust in the blockchain network.</p>\n<p>I hope that clarifies the role of full nodes and SPV wallets in verifying transactions using the Merkle tree!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>if root gives you the merkle root and branch/path information for your transcation. so my transction is in the block then the node provides the info then why we need to verify.</h3>\n<p>Verification is necessary to ensure the integrity and validity of the information provided by the node. In a decentralized system like a blockchain network, there is no central authority to trust, so it's important to have mechanisms in place to verify the information provided by the nodes in the network.</p>\n<p>By providing you with the Merkle root and branch/path information for your transaction, the node is giving you the tools to independently verify that your transaction is indeed included in the block. This allows you to trust the information provided by the node without having to blindly rely on their honesty.</p>\n<p>In summary, verifying the Merkle root and branch/path information for your transaction helps ensure that the information provided by the node is accurate and trustworthy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>tell me with another example how hashing works in searching . explain it with simple example.</h3>\n<p>Sure! Here's another simple example to help you understand how hashing works in searching: Imagine you have a library with thousands of books and you want to quickly find a particular book. One way to do this is to use a hash table.</p>\n<p>A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys (in this case, the titles of the books) to values (in this case, the location of the books in the library). The hash function takes each book title as input and produces a hash as output. This hash is then used as an index to store the value in the hash table.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you have the following books in your library: \"Moby-Dick\", \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"The Great Gatsby\". You can use a hash function to calculate the hash for each book title and store the location of each book in the hash table at the corresponding hash index. The hash table might look something like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hash Index</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\"Aisle 3, Row 2\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\"Aisle 1, Row 4\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\"Aisle 2, Row 1\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>\"Aisle 4, Row 3\"</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now, if you want to search for the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", you can calculate its hash using the same hash function and use it as an index to look up its value in the hash table. In this case, the value at index 3 is \"Aisle 2, Row 1\", which means that \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is located in aisle 2, row 1 in the library.</p>\n<p>This is just another simple example to illustrate how hashing can be used in searching. In practice, there are many details and complexities involved in implementing an efficient and robust hash table.</p>\n<p>I hope this example helps clarify how hashing works in searching. Is there anything else you would like to know?</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>ok but now it have to search the hash index linearly then how it is fast.</h3>\n<p>In a hash table, you don't have to search for the hash index linearly. Instead, the hash function calculates the hash index directly based on the input data. This allows you to directly access the value at the calculated hash index without having to search for it.</p>\n<p>For example, in the previous example where we used a hash table to find books in a library, we calculated the hash of the book title \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" using a hash function. This hash function took the book title as input and produced a hash index as output. In this case, the calculated hash index was 3.</p>\n<p>Since we already know the hash index, we can directly access the value at index 3 in the hash table without having to search for it. This is much faster than having to search through all the entries in the hash table to find the one we're looking for.</p>\n<p>In summary, hashing is fast because it allows for direct access to the data using a calculated hash index instead of having to search for it linearly.</p>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"title":"aws","author":"Author Name","time":"25/02/2017","summary":"This is a summary of the blog post...abc def gfhy iiii olol olkmn lokjmm kijuyhgtr nhbngvfdc ","article":"Magazine","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/7ffa0/2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/2d143/2.jpg 133w,\n/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/30567/2.jpg 267w,\n/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/7ffa0/2.jpg 533w","sizes":"(min-width: 533px) 533px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/62dd2/2.webp 133w,\n/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/d32ea/2.webp 267w,\n/static/5388abd8ec39a3488844059497dc3f48/acf03/2.webp 533w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 533px) 533px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":400.75046904315195}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/art/blockchain/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
